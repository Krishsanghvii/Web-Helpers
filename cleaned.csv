list output impedance possibly embarrassed anyway focusrite one reason trust little output impedance less ohmsrespectable but not amazing still not low would need principle but notice improvement bass response headphones theres plenty extra voltage could drive higher impedance cans if necessary anyway good headphone amp check balanced ins outs work well ins accommodates trs style xlr light around

sturdy attractive well usb cable type b port means replace if gets damaged whatever behringer example hardwired cableking annoying buspowered actually would fine wallwart but even simplei really no complaints whatsoever hardware bad driver thing horrible windows xp clean installation nothing installed except daw software acrobat reader driver mean computer really stripped down performance using behringer good latency time playing note hearing speakers ms using behringer isnt really perceptibleunfortunately focusrite driver though technically asio apparently doesnt anything like acceptable latency lowest latency could set get sound instead crackles pops ms level instrument begins sound sluggish laggy difficult least work large latency like thati ready return device decided last ditch effort install thats sort asio driver use if absolutely cannot make manufacturers driver perform decent level installed worked output latency tiny ms actually output latency really impressive conclude hardware good machine but software horribleunfortunately cant actually uninstall focusrite driver otherwise windows doesnt recognize device never even turns onits not class compliant unlike behringer two drivers installed one usethe bad news configuration buggy general turn computer try play vst instrument get crackles pops open asio configuration panel increase buffer funny thing doesnt matter buffer starts always increase get good sounds start huge bufferlots latencyand will crackle open increase buffer yet every time turn computer also sometimes if leave come back will crackly increase yet another step talking major bugs herei decided try ditching trying make focusrite drivers work againmaybe setting missing trying set buffer size heard sound explosion computer rebooted came back couldnt get good sounds even turned buffer way tried rebooting times still didnt work uninstalled reinstalled focusrite software first didnt work install well sort get sounds half timei hope getting idea drivers terrible awful monkey could written better driver would give star if wasnt fact device works well stars align driver recognizes drive allows play guess im willing sacrifice convenience stability nice hardware works would never use live situation time criticalthe good thing drivers update fix im hoping already revised driver amazing even driver seriously abomination like closing thoughts unfortunately really isnt usb interface good driver behringer driver always worked but if moved interface one usb port no longer recognized reinstall driver however didnt use behringer driver would give ms perform without complications thats trouble free ive seen type deviceif read presonus audiobox usb maudio fast track pro probably two closest competitors focusrite get bunch comments like onehorrible horrible drivers never get fixed actually mackie makes competitor well onyx blackjackbut reviews show driver possibly even worse one unfortunately none pro music manufacturers cares drivers live unstable systems work half time maybe better mac dont knowinterestingly really usb device range thats quite shocking considering long usb standard around real implication usb devices like maudio presonus two channel audio not time theres not enough throughput usb light competition focusrite looks kind ok unfortunately audio interface manufacturersat least range devicethink theres no need good hardware especially good software least hardware one spec cross fingers improved drivers futurebottom line fantastic deviceif make software work consistentlyif tight budget dont care balanced inout id recommend go behringer tons cheaper class complaint better drivers if use high impedance headphone even headphone amp pretty good one update may new version driver came since writing new driver actually works stopped using get decent latency whilenot oftenit will inexplicably require edit settings increase buffer percentage time will reboot computer if dont change anything time
